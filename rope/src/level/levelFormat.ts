// Canonical, hand-editable level format — the single source of truth for the
// level schema, shared by the runtime loaders (`Level`, `BallLevel`) and the
// level editor. `levelData.ts` is auto-generated from a Godot scene and stays
// untouched; its narrower body-kind union is structurally assignable to this
// superset, so generated levels load through this format unchanged.
//
// Geometry is authored in Godot/scene pixels (as in the generated data); the
// simulation runs in metres. `scaleLevelData(data, PX)` converts on load and
// `scaleLevelData(data, PIXELS_PER_METER)` converts back for saving to disk.

// Body kinds a level can contain:
// - static:      immovable geometry the rope wraps and bodies collide with.
// - impermeable: static, but hooks are destroyed on contact instead of attaching.
// - killzone:    an Area2D that resets the level when the avatar enters it.
// - rigid:       a dynamic RigidBody2D (gravity + collisions), authored in place.
// - force:       an Area2D that accelerates every body inside it along the
//                area's own rotation (a river current, wind, an updraft).
